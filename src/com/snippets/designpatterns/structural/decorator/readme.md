### Description

- adds/modifies features to a class
- does not necessarily change the main object
- it uses composition to add new features

Pitfalls: 
- end up adding to many classes for each extension
- relies on inheritance too much
- could end up having too many hierarchical inheritance and be hard to maintain
- requires developers to know about all available decorated classes
